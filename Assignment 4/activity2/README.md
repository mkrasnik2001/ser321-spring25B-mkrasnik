# Description 
This is a simple Sudoku game. Many players can play a separate game but see the same leaderboard. Player can type "exit" at any point during the game state to quit the game and disconnect the client from the server.

## How to run the program
1. `cd` into `activity2` direc inside `Assignment\ 4`  
2. Build the gradle project by running `gradle clean build`  
3. Start the server by running `gradle runServer`  
4. Start the client(s) by running `gradle runClient`  
   - Default port is `8000` and default host is `localhost`  
   - Port and hostIP specification is optional.  
5. To run the grading version run `gradle runServerGrading`. This will run the same thing, but with the graded board that also shows up on the server side for convenience.

### PLEASE NOTE

* The unit test "Testing game flow to Leaderboard" was commented out because of the comment in it: _this test only passes when that person has not logged in yet!! Could be done better but here we are_
* For `gradle clean build` to work the unit tests have to pass and for them to pass the `gradle runServerGrading` needs to be running. So if these unit tests will be used for grading,
please comment out the whole unit test file, build the gradle project and then uncomment the unit tests and build again or run `gradle test`. Thank you!
